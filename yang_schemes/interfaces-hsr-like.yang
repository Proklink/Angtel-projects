             counters are also counted against the IETF interfaces
             statistics.  In particular, they are included in

             in-unicast-pkts, in-multicast-pkts or in-broadcast-pkts,
             because they are not delivered to a higher layer.

             Discontinuities in the values of this counters in this
             container can occur at re-initialization of the
             management system, and at other times as indicated by
